# AstRal HeaRts: Open Source
AstRal HeaRts: Open Souce (AH:OS) is an open sourced version of AstRal HeaRts built on the AeroGameFramework, and was initially started in August 2019. This release does not have all the assets as the fully released version, but does contain Floor 1 to provide reference as to how the game's workspace is to be laid out. **This project will not work out of the box** because the game's code does rely on assets owned by the Team Sayo group. At the time of release, I'm figuring out how to release some of these in a proper fashion so that they can be used standalone.

This project is being released under the Creative Commons 1.0 license, so you are free to use, reuse, repurpose, do whatever you want with the code here. Even re-release it commercially. We do ask that you credit Team Sayo and or seyai for it, although you are not obliged.
